# Academic Violations

**All assginments are individual work. You can discuss with your peer about possible technologies and solutions but the assignment result (the submission) is your sole work**. The following things would be considered violations:
* Reuse existing work without clear clarification of the reuse and what is the new work
  - it is always safe to write clearly how you reuse the code/material and provide a reference
* Copy any part of existing solutions (code, design, document, etc.) from others

We do not have automatical assignment evaluation and we read, check and run the assignment so the chance we detect a violation is **high**
>Besides tools are also used for code and text similarity analysis

The violation handing procedure (based on Aalto):
* [The Aalto detailed procedure](https://into.aalto.fi/display/ensaannot/Aalto+University+Code+of+Academic+Integrity+and+Handling+Violations+Thereof#AaltoUniversityCodeofAcademicIntegrityandHandlingViolationsThereof-4.4Procedure)
* Evidence (violated code, design, document, ...) will be sent to **the School LES Manager**
  - The LES Manager will contact the students and have a hearing
  - The (vice)dean will decide based on these, what will happen:
     >In case of violation: assignment cannot be evaluated (not accepted).
      **The school will record the student in the case** (more severe consequences if the student has already marking of violations)
    > If the case is not violated, we will continue the  evaluation
